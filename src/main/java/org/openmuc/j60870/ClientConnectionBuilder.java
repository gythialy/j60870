/**
 * The client connection builder is used to connect to IEC 60870-5-104 servers. A client application
 * that wants to connect to a server should first create an instance of {@link
 * ClientConnectionBuilder}. Next all the necessary configuration parameters can be set. Finally the
 * {@link ClientConnectionBuilder#build()} function is called to connect to the server. An instance
 * of {@link ClientConnectionBuilder} can be used to create an unlimited number of connections.
 * Changing the parameters of a {@link ClientConnectionBuilder} has no affect on connections that
 * have already been created.
 *
 * <p>Note that the configured lengths of the fields COT, CA and IOA have to be the same for all
 * communicating nodes in a network. The default values used by {@link ClientConnectionBuilder} are
 * those most commonly used in IEC 60870-5-104 communication.
